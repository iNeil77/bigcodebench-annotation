# Method
def task_func(goals, penalties, rng_seed=None):
    """
    Generate a Pandas DataFrame with colomns 'Team' and 'Match Result' of the results of football matches for multiple
    teams, incorporating random goals and penalties. Penalties are converted into fines using a predefined cost.

    Parameters:
    - goals (int): The maximum number of goals a team can score in a match. Must be non-negative.
    - penalties (int): The maximum number of penalties a team can receive in a match. Must be non-negative.
    - rng_seed (int, optional): Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducible results. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with columns ['Team', 'Match Result'], detailing each team's goals and accumulated fines.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - random

    Example:
    >>> seed(42)  # Setting seed for reproducibility in this example
    >>> results = task_func(5, 3, 42)
    >>> print(results)
