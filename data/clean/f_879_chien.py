    """
    Visualize two Series using a swarm plot with a highlight on their intersecting data points.

    This function creates a swarm plot to visually compare two pandas Series. 
    It highlights the intersection points between these two series by drawing red dashed lines at the intersecting data points.

    Parameters:
    - s1 (pd.Series): The first series of data. This series must have a unique name that identifies it in the plot.
    - s2 (pd.Series): The second series of data. Similar to s1, this series must also have a unique name.

    Returns:
    - ax (matplotlib.Axes): The Axes object of the plotted swarm chart. This object can be used for further customization of the plot if required.
    intersection_count (int): The number of unique intersecting data points between s1 and s2. 
    This count gives a quick numerical summary of the overlap between the two series.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib

    Example:
    >>> s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], name='Series1')
    >>> s2 = pd.Series([4, 5, 6, 7, 8], name='Series2')
    >>> ax, count = f_879(s1, s2)
    >>> ax.get_title()
    'Overlap Between Series1 and Series2'
