def f_699(students, subjects, seed=None):
    """
    Create a grade report for a list of students across various subjects. Each student's grades are randomly generated, 
    and the report includes the average grade for each student. The randomness is seeded for reproducibility if a seed is provided.

    Parameters:
    students (list of str): The students for whom the report is being generated.
    subjects (list of str): The subjects included in the report.
    seed (int, optional): A seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. If None, the randomness is seeded by the system.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing each student's grades across the subjects and their average grade. 
               Columns are ['Student', 'Subject1', 'Subject2', ..., 'Average Grade'].

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - statistics
    - random

    Example:
    >>> students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
    >>> subjects = ['Math', 'Physics', 'English']
    >>> report = f_699(students, subjects, seed=123)
    >>> print(report)
       Student  Math  Physics  English  Average Grade
    0    Alice     6       34       11      17.000000
    1      Bob    98       52       34      61.333333
    2  Charlie    13        4       48      21.666667
