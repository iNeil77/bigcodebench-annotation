    '''
    Introduces a delay of 'delay_time' seconds in a specified number of separate threads and 
    returns the thread completion messages.

    Parameters:
    - delay_time (float): Amounf of delay time in seconds. Defalut is 1.
    - num_threads (int): Number of threads in which the delay should be introduced. Default is 5.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of strings containing the completion messages of the threads.
            The completion message looks as follow:
            'Delay in thread x completed'

    Requirements:
    - time
    - threading

    Example:
    >>> f_684(0.1, 3)
    ['Delay in thread 0 completed', 'Delay in thread 1 completed', 'Delay in thread 2 completed']

    >>> f_684(1, 10)
    ['Delay in thread 0 completed', 'Delay in thread 1 completed', 'Delay in thread 2 completed', 'Delay in thread 3 completed', 'Delay in thread 4 completed', 'Delay in thread 5 completed', 'Delay in thread 6 completed', 'Delay in thread 7 completed', 'Delay in thread 8 completed', 'Delay in thread 9 completed']
