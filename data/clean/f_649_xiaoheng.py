    Generate n random points within a circle of radius RADIUS (default value is 5) and return their average distance from the center.

    Parameters:
    - n (int): The number of points to be generated.

    Returns:
    - float: The average distance from the center of the circle.

    Requirements:
    - math
    - random
    - statistics

    Example:
    >>> random.seed(42)

    >>> f_649(50)
    3.4443
