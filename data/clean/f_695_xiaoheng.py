def f_695(n_sentences):
    """
    Generate a string of random sentences using a predefined word list. 
    Each sentence is guaranteed to have one period at the end, and no period within the sentence.
    The generated sentences will be concatenated into a single string, 
    with all letters in lowercase and all non-alphanumeric characters except spaces removed.

    Parameters:
    - n_sentences (int): The number of sentences to generate.

    Returns:
    - str: A string containing the generated sentences in lowercase 
         with non-alphanumeric characters removed (except for single periods ending sentences).
    
    Requirements:
    - random
    - re
    
    Example:
    >>> random.seed(42)
    >>> result = f_695(2)
    >>> print(result)
    sample sample including contains text text text including sample including. words sample words several sample sample sample text text words.
    
    Note: 
    - The actual output will vary due to the randomness of sentence generation.
